#min/max functions used in place of conditionals

def clip(lo, x, hi):
    '''
    Takes in three numbers and returns a value based on the value of x.
    Returns:
     - lo, when x < lo
     - hi, when x > hi
     - x, otherwise
    '''

    return max(lo, min(hi, x))    #this is confusing but correct
clip(3, 10, 5)
