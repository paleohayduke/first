My answer isn't matching up with the test results for this code



Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.

The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will pay off all debt in under 1 year

Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative using this payment scheme, which is okay. A summary of the required math is found below:

Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum fixed monthly payment)
Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)
"""

balance = 3329
annualInterestRate = 0.2
payment = 0
month = 0
moInRa = annualInterestRate/12
    
while month < 13:
    month += 1
    remMonth = 13 - month
    
    if month > 1:
        balance = balance - payment
        balance = balance + balance*moInRa
    
    while balance - (payment*remMonth) > 0:
        payment += 10
